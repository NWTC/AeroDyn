# AeroDyn
AeroDyn is a time-domain wind turbine aerodynamics module that has been coupled into the FAST version 8 multi-physics engineering tool to enable aero-elastic simulation of horizontal-axis wind turbines. AeroDyn can also be driven as a standalone code to compute wind turbine aerodynamic response uncoupled from FAST.

AeroDyn was developed by NREL under U.S. Department of Energy support.  NREL gratefully acknowledges the development contributions from the following organizations:
